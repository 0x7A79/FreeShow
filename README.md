## Short description

FreeShow is a presentation program to easily show text on a big screen, with support for stage display, remote control, media, and many more advanced features. It is open sourced meaning anyone can contribute.

I created this program because of all the programs I have tried, they was either way too expensive or unnecessarily hard to use. This can be used for free everywhere, from a small church to a big concert.

> Please note that the program is still in active development

## Donate?

Creating such a program takes a lot of my time, so if you would like to help me continue developing this, a donation would be awesome.
